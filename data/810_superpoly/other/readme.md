'balance:22 ' represents that k22 is a balanced variable in the superpoly.

'20 21 22 64'  represents that this superpoly involves k20,k21,k22,k64.

'allnum:4' represents that this superpoly involves 4 secret variables.

'res_70_52_48_29' represents the cube I/{70,52,48,29} where I is the mother cube.
